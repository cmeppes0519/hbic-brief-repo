1. Investing ?

Significance:
Big picture ? Investing: ?Investing in Community Power - California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) (.gov)? signals where the puck is sliding. From an operator lens this touches cost curves, risk exposure, and workflow friction. Short-term, watch the usual tells: who actually ships something vs. doing a press tour; any regulatory/payer moves; and whether unit economics get clearer or murkier. Medium-term, expect fast followers and ?partnerships? that are really distribution. Your edge: treat the headline as a roadmap for experiments you can run this week, not a prophecy from California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) (.gov).
Bestie Sidebar:
Bestie Sidebar (with love and shade): If it doesn?t move margin, throughput, or legal risk, it?s d?cor. Smile at the buzzwords, then ask for the dashboard, the metric, and the date it changes. Translation: no timeline, no KPI, no budget = vibes only. Keep receipts; forward the nonsense; and make one tiny, measurable change today so future-you can say ?told you so.?
