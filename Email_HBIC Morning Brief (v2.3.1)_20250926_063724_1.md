Big picture ? Psychological Thrillers: ?10 Psychological Thrillers Everyone Can Agree Are 10/10 (#1 Is The Best Movie Of The 21st Century) - Screen Rant? signals where the puck is sliding. From an operator lens this touches cost curves, risk exposure, and workflow friction. Short-term, watch the usual tells: who actually ships something vs. doing a press tour; any regulatory/payer moves; and whether unit economics get clearer or murkier.
