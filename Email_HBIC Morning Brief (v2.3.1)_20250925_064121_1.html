      <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Big picture ? Revenue Cycle Management: ?Jorie to Reveal the Most Advanced Automation Ever Seen in Revenue Management at HLTH 2025 - azcentral.com and The Arizona Republic? signals where the puck is sliding. From an operator lens this touches cost curves, risk exposure, and workflow friction. Short-term, watch the usual tells: who actually ships something vs. doing a press tour; any regulatory/payer moves; and whether unit economics get clearer or murkier. Medium-term, expect fast followers and ?partnerships? that are really distribution. Your edge: treat the headline as a roadmap for experiments you can run this week, not a prophecy from azcentral.com and The Arizona Republic.</p>
